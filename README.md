# html5-startup-kit

## Description

This repository includes materials related to my course Writing in Digital Environments at Ball State University. Specifically, these materials are designed to provide a **lo-fi entry** entry into editing HTML documents within one to two class sessions.

Drawing on Karl Stolley's call for a lo-fi approach to teaching and producing digital rhetoric, these documents are designed to present simple and easy avenues to experiment with web-production and publishing for students unfamiliar with digital tools.

What these materials **are**:

- Simple.
- Human-readable, as much possible.
- HTML-oriented.
- Accessibility-focused.
- Iterative and subject to ongoing revision.

What these materials **are not**:

- Exhaustive.
- CSS-oriented.
- Mobile-ready. (Though I plan to add that at some point.)
- Professionally-oriented.

Again, these resources should be seen as a first step for students and interested amateurs to experiment with basic HTML editing. Once you've made your way through these very ground-level (but no less important!) ideas, I recommend downloading a template from HTML5Up and see how it extends these basic ideas.

## How to Use these Files

To make use of these files, carry out the following steps:

- Ensure that you have an HTML-ready text editor installed on your machine. If you need a recommendation, I would suggest Atom.
- Download these files by clicking the green "Code" dropdown menu and selecting "Download ZIP." Unzip the file and move the folder to wherever you'd like.
- In Atom (or your text-editor of choice), select "File > Add Project Folder" and navigate to, and open the folder. Now you should see the HTML source files in Atom.
- Finally, open your browser of choice and select "File > Open File." Using the menu navigate to the folder you downloaded and open the index.html file.

At this point, you'll be able to see the source files in Atom and the way they'll be displayed on the Web in your browser. All that's left to do is read them! I've tried to be fairly explanatory in the source HTML, but here are a few things that will help your reading:

### comments

HTML, like most markup and programming and languages, allows writers to embed comments in their source files that aren't displayed on the Web. (People can look at your source files in published HTML sites, however, and will see your comments.) The comment syntax looks like this:

> <!-- Here's a comment! -->

Note that comments are also used to make a certain part of the text "inactive," as well. For example, you'll see in the files that I've commented out the CSS stylesheet so that you focus primarily on the HTML. There are instructions to remove the commented out section later in the index.html which, in the case of the previous example, would look like this:

> Here's a comment!

### Opening Tags and Closing Tags

Tags are the name for markup elements in HTML (also often referred to as elements). In **nearly** all cases, tags with also include closing tags, and closing tags are indicated with a forward slash. Creating a paragraph, for example, will look like this:

> <p>Some paragraph text.</p>

## Closing Thoughts

If you're reading these documents on Github, please let me know if you have any suggestions for how to improve them and / or fork and push changes. Keep in mind, though, that extreme simplicity is the goal.
